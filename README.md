# libft

This project, called `libft`, is the first project you will be working on at 42 School. The purpose of this project is to recreate some of the standard C library functions, as well as to create some additional useful functions that you may find helpful in future projects. You will need to implement these functions from scratch, without using the actual standard library functions.

## Building the library

To build the library, you will need to compile all of the source files into a static library. You can do this using the `make` command. This will create a `libft.a` file in your project directory, which you can link to your other projects.

To use the functions from libft.a, include the `#include "libft.h"` header in your `main.c`. Compile and run them like this:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror libft.a main.c && ./a.out
```

## Conclusion

The libft project is an important foundation for all of the other projects you will be working on at 42 School. It will help you to become more familiar with the standard library functions, as well as with creating your own library functions. By completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of the basics of programming in C, which will be invaluable in your future projects.
